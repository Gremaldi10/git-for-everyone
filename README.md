# Git for everyone

Unless you have been living in a cave, Git is everywhere. Creative or engineering, you have directly encountered or will encounter Git in the workplace. A common misconception as well is that Git is only for teams? Regardless of work style or team size, Git is the tool that everyone should be using.

Code Fellows instructors will introduce you to Git and get you up to speed on concepts and workflows in this workshop.

Discover how working in the command line isn't all that scary. Understand how to move between projects with just a few key strokes. Visually experience what Git is doing behind the scenes. Gain confidence with the steps involved for a common Git branching strategy. Cloning isn't just for sheep and galactic empires.

Together we will all create and share Github repositories and understand why Groundhog Day is the best Git movie EVER!
